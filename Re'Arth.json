      "Backstory": "You’re here…Fuck... I guess you want me to tell you my story… Fine, but you gotta buy me a drink first, and the rest of my drinks while I tell you my story. Don’t look at me like that. Get your ass to the bar and get me an ale. \r\n Welcome back. Now give me that ale… Ohh that hits the spot. Where to begin? I guess with my name. I’m Damaia Vanan but most people call me Auburn on a count of my hair. I’m the daughter of Barakaus Vanan, my father, and Rieta Sedlak, my mother. \r\n My parents were both Tieflings of the Zariel bloodline. My father worked as an adventurer and my mother was…  or is a merchant… I guess. I haven’t seen her in a few years, she’s a bitch. But let's talk about my father for a bit. He told me that when he met my mother he fell in love. He courted her and soon they married. A few years later they had me. My father loved me and gave up going on adventures to be home with me and my mother, which hurt my mother’s business because she could no longer sell the items he had been bringing home. She divorced him when I was around 5 or 6 years old. She remarried very quickly, looking back on it she might have been having an affair. The man she married was a human-pig named Brutus Wolgang. He was a noble and was able to help her business grow more. He died when I was 10. I have one step-brother from that marriage, Percy Wolgang, and two step-sisters, Serina Wolgang and Helania Wolgang. \r\n From that time on my time was split between my father and mother. My step-siblings being older than me would bully me. My mother had me working in her store all day long. Whenever my step-sisters came to the store to visit they would break things and then blame me. I would be punished by my mother. By the time I was 14 my mother started to keep me away from my father and would not let me see him. I was forced to work longer hours and do more things around the store while my step-siblings got to go about their normal noble lives. \r\n I was frustrated with how I was being treated by my mother and step-siblings. So I ran away and went to find my father. \r\n After I returned to my father and told him what had happened to me, he started to train me to fight and use weapons so I could protect myself in the future. So this couldn’t happen to me anymore.\r\n When I was 16 I started working for the city guard, with my father. Just before I turned 17 I started to date Seirye Willowrun. After about six months I would spend some nights at her house and other nights she would sleep at my house. \r\n After I turned 18 my father got very sick. As he lay dying he gave me a letter for his youngest sister, Makaria D’mone in Gallow’s End. Shortly afterward he died. After the funeral, I went to see Seirye. When I entered her house I could hear the sounds of her moans coming from the bedroom, I knew these sounds well as I had made her moan like that many times before, and there were clothes on the floor, and some of the clothes were not hers. \r\n I quietly opened the door to see her on her back with a man between her legs. She was moaning from what he was doing to her. I quietly left her house and returned to my father’s house, which was now mine. I packed my things and headed to my captain’s office to let him know that I had to make a trip to Gallow’s End and I wasn’t sure when I would be back. Then I left Telmarand. \r\n Now go get me another ale, my bitch! My throat is parched.",

      "Information": "Elf\r\nDuring the Sundering of the world, the humans that took refugee in the forests of the world were changed into Elves. The rampaging magic created a connection between the trees and the newly formed Elves. Their skin, eyes, and hair colors changed to resemble the bark and leaves colors of the trees. They build their cities as part of the forest. \r\n\r\nThey have a grace that is otherworldly, their forest cities are filled with soft music and art.  \r\n\r\nElves don’t use metal for armor, weapons, or tools. They don’t cut down trees, they communicate with the trees and ask the tree to shape itself into what they want to make using magic. Once the tree has shaped the tool they need, the crafters use magic to strengthen the wood to be as hard as metal. \r\n\r\nMost Elves think that axes are an abhorrent weapon to use because their primary usage is to cut down trees. \r\n\r\nElves do not celebrate the birth of their children, but the conception of children. Elven women know when they have conceived of a child. \r\n\r\nAll Elves get the following abilities:\r\nAbility Score Increase: +2 to Dexterity. \r\n\r\nAge: Elves age at about half the speed of humans reaching physical maturity around 36 years old. They are not viewed as adults till around 100 years old and can live to be around 750 to 1000 years old. \r\n\r\nSize: Elves range from under 5 feet to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Their size is Medium.\r\n\r\nSpeed: Their base walking speed is 30 feet.\r\n\r\nDarkvision: Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, Elves have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. Elves can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Elves can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. \r\n\r\nConnection to the trees: Elves have an advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t elves to sleep. \r\n\r\nTrance: Elves do not sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is \"trance.\" While meditating, they dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, they gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep. \r\n\r\nKeen Senses: Elves have proficiency in the Perception skill.\r\n\r\nLanguages: Elves speak, read and write, Elven and Common. \r\n",

The rod has Properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other Properties as well, detailed below.\r\n\r\nSix Buttons: You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a Bonus Action. A button's Effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\r\n\r\nIf you press button 1, the rod becomes a Flame Tongue as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head.\r\n\r\nIf you press button 2, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with it.\r\n\r\nIf you press button 3, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a+3 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with it.\r\n\r\nIf you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a Ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\r\n\r\nIf you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and gram its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\r\n\r\nIf you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a Location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\r\n\r\nDrain Life: When you hit a creature with a melee Attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target rakes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\r\n\r\nParalyze: When you hit a creature with a melee Attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is Paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, Ending the Effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\r\n\r\nTerrify: While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is Frightened of you for 1 minute. A Frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, Ending the Effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.",
